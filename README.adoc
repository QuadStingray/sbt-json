# SBT Json

This is an plugin to read from an JSON-File in your SBT Tasks. If you are using https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog[Conventional Changelog] you have to insert your version number in an package.json file. It is not comfortable to update your version at many points in your project. So this plugin supports you read the Version Number or other Settings from a JSON-File in your Build Process.

## Usage
Add to your project/plugins.sbt
```sbt
  addSbtPlugin("dev.quadstingray" % "sbt-json" % pluginVersion)
```

### Use the JsonHandler
By default, the package.json in your Root-Folder is inserted in the JsonHandler.
```sbt
version := jsonHandler.value.stringValue("package.json", "version")
```

To add another Json-File to the Handler
```sbt
jsonFiles += (baseDirectory.value / "second.json")
organization := jsonHandler.value.stringValue("second.json", "organization")
```

### Direct JsonFile

```sbt
val json = JsonFile(file("package.json"))

organization := json.stringValue("organization")
```
